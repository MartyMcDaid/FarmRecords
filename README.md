# FarmRecords
Windows form based application to track sheep on a farm. Start off simple and maybe build to something greater.

Starting off simple, the form will record a few simple details as regards identification numbers of the sheep
date of bith or purchase and the numbers of associated documents, the status of the sheep as to whether it is active,
lost, sold and the breed.
 
 The aim is to have this save to and read from a database, and later be able to record and link events such as births,
 and treatments etc.
